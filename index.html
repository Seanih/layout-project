            <p>Hey, I'm a front-end developer who is genuinely surprised and thankful that TeamTreehouse is 
               working out so well for me. I spent 2 months in a 6 month long bootcamp from Thinkful/UWM 
               earlier this summer and dropped out because I felt they were significantly overcharging for what
               they were providing, especially since they lacked videos (we were basically reading PDFs to ourselves
               and having 2 hours a week with a mentor, so yeah, 3K for 2 months of that). I'm easily grasping 
               concepts here that I was struggling with before, so I appreciate what you all are providing!
